                Executive Leadership Program in Monitoring and Evaluation for
                Public Institutions and Agencies
              </h3>
              <p>
                The profession and practice of monitoring and evaluation are
                still evolving. Experiences and innovations in the Africa,
                including those based on indigenous contexts, cultures and ways
                of knowing and doing, offer significant potential to enhance
                monitoring and evaluation theory and practice. Monitoring and
                Evaluation is a relatively new field that has emerged from a
                diverse array of applied social sciences. Although it is
                practice-oriented, there has been a proliferation of programs in
                monitoring and evaluation that just prescribe to theory than
                actual practice. The Executive leadership program in Monitoring
                and Evaluation for Public Institutions and Agencies is being
                designed to bridge the gap between theory and practices. It is
                being led by a team of professional who combines years of
                extensive practical experience in monitoring and evaluation for
                development in international institutions as well as
                Africa-based organizations. They are roots in practical
                experience gained in many very different parts of the world, yet
                are fully aware of all the theories and practices that have
                shaped evaluation as profession.
