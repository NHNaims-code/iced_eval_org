                ICED seeks to provide leadership in continuously research,
                develop and deploy cutting-edge and cost-effective innovations
                and best practices, to transform evaluation, to promote data
                driven decision making aimed at accelerating development in
                Africa. In addition, ICED want to raise the visibility,
                awareness, influence and of overall contribution of ICED on the
                continent. ICED intend to achieve this vision through three
                broad strategies; (a) Innovations in Evaluation Research, (b)
                Collaborations with Strategic Partners, and (c) Evaluation
                Knowledge Management.
