              <h4>Introduction</h4>
              <p>
                In order to fulfill its mandate, the International Center for
                Evaluation and Development (ICED) needs to design and deploy a
                dynamic Policy Engagement, Knowledge Management and
                Communication Strategy. As the first Africa-based international
                think-tank that seeks to leverage on ongoing research and
                evaluation projects, the institution needs to design and
                implement a strong stakeholder engagement strategy and
                aggressively go out to market its vision and strategy in order
                to secure support for its agenda by various stakeholders.
              </p>
              <p>
              As a Africa-based and Africa-led Think and Do Tank ICED is obligated to keep all Africa stakeholders informed of its progress, achievements, and lessons learnt against investments made into the institution. The ICED Policy Engagement and Communications (PEC) strategy will therefore incorporate a strong knowledge management focus and will aim to enhance the understanding of the organization by its stakeholders and position the organization as a though-leader at the regional and global level. Aside from enhancing visibility and brand positioning of the organization, an aggressive communication, policy engagement and knowledge management strategy will seek to help the ICED management and its partners influence policy and practice change within the African continent.
              </p>
              <p>
                Positioning ICED as a strong brand requires a clear
                understanding of the organization’s stakeholders and the
                development of clear messages targeting specific audiences. Our
                communications strategy will also include a strong advocacy
                agenda and will involve a proactive rather than reactive
                approach. Further, the strategy will seek foster accessibility
                and transparency for ICED by clearly demonstrating to its
                stakeholders that the organization is managing resources
                prudently and that its products and services offer value for
                money.
              </p>
              <p>
                In summary the PEC strategy is expected to achieve the
                following:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Promote a positive image and brand for ICED at the regional
                    and global level
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Create buy-in and support for the ICED mission and work that
                    the organization is doing
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Share information, knowledge and learning from the
                    organization and its partners to the wider public
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Foster engagement with policy makers, partners and carefully
                    identified stakeholders with a view to influencing, shaping
                    and informing policy and practice as well as decision making
                  </li>
                  <li>Strengthen internal communications</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h4>Vision</h4>
              <p>
                To position the organization as the go-to institution in the
                provision of policy engagement, results-focused monitoring and
                evaluation, knowledge management and impact evaluation expertise
                in Africa.
              </p>
              <h4>Overall Goal</h4>
              <p>
                The Policy Engagement and Communications (PEC) strategy seeks to
                position ICED as a thought leader and influencer in the African
                development landscape. Our aim is to position the organization
                as a unique, credible and trusted voice within the monitoring
                and evaluation (M&E) and Impact Evaluation industry in the
                continent. Taking advantage of key global and regional policy
                frameworks such as the SDGs and the Malabo declaration, we seek
                to ensure that the organization’s internal team and external
                stakeholders understand the organization’s strategic approach
                and deliver on its strategic objectives in a seamless manner.
              </p>
              <h4>Our Strategic Objectives</h4>
              <p>
                The strategy will be implemented around five key strategic
                objectives as follows:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    To build and sustain a strong brand and profile for ICED
                    aimed at generating buy-in for the organization’s business
                    models and approaches among its key stakeholders
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To promote policy and practice reforms and become the
                    leading voice in championing for evidence-based,
                    results-focused and business-driven development in Africa.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To enrich documentation and knowledge sharing to demonstrate
                    the impact of ICED and its partner’s investments and
                    contribution to the African development sector.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To enhance accountability and foster confidence within
                    African governments, the donor community and other
                    stakeholders regarding the authenticity of ICED’s governance
                    and management of resources.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To build and sustain a progressive internal communications
                    culture within ICED that promotes staff awareness about the
                    institution’s work.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h4>Our Approach</h4>
              <p>
                Aside from seeking to create a strong global brand for ICED, the
                organization’s policy engagement, knowledge management and
                communications approach is partnership-oriented and seeks to
                creatively utilize knowledge and research results generated by
                the organization and its partners to inspire policy and practice
                changes. Our goal is support the organization’s objective to
                catalyze transformative change amongst communities and citizens
                at large. Our communications strategy will seek to inspire
                positive action by policymakers, beneficiaries and other actors
                in the development sector. Working with programme teams, the PEC
                Department will create a platform for various stakeholders to
                define dynamic approaches to be deployed in supporting the
                policy formulation and implementation process. Our team will
                seek to generate powerful and dynamic dialogues and
                conversations between stakeholders from government, the public
                sector, private sector, ordinary citizens etc through the
                provision of various platforms for engagement.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Policy Engagement and Communications Program also seeks to
                ensure the effective utilization of the numerous research
                findings and information coming out of M&E assignments and
                impact evaluations derived from projects undertaken by academics
                and other actors in the development sector, with an aim of
                driving a progressive change agenda. We seek to ensure that
                research and knowledge coming out of the continent effectively
                informs the design of organizational policies and strategies,
                institutional program and projects and events both at the local,
                regional and global level. All of this is done with an aim of
                enhancing accountability, good governance, generating buy-in for
                new knowledge and generating public support for the approaches
                and projects designed by various institutions. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Our public engagement, communications and knowledge management
                work will be implemented around ICED’s five cross-cutting
                themes. By identifying and tracking cutting-edge research and
                M&E projects being undertaken by ICED and its partner
                institutions, show-casing best practices and positioning our
                partners as thought leaders, we will seek to leverage on new and
                existing knowledge in the global south to drive a systemic
                change agenda. In our communication and engagement efforts, we
                will target several groups including decision-makers in
                government, the business community, civil society organizations,
                farmer organization and the academic sector. 
              </p>
              <p>
                In implementing our Policy Engagement and Communications
                strategy, we will leverage on ICED management’s vast experience
                in evaluation and impact assessment work. We will ensure results
                and findings from strategic evaluations and impact assessments
                done by ICED and its partners are packaged into various products
                and properly disseminated at local, regional and the global
                level. The PEC team will seek to support ICED’s partners to
                develop creative and dynamic policy engagement, knowledge
                management and communications strategies that enable them meet
                their research and policy influencing goals. Further, the
                Program will support organizations to establish effective
                knowledge management systems and to disseminate program research
                results outlining key findings and recommendations to various
                stakeholders.
              </p>
              <p>
                Internally, PEC team seek to build capacity of the various
                Programs to be able to effectively package and disseminate
                research results and knowledge coming out of various projects
                with the duty bearers and carefully targeted audiences. Our
                strategy will include a strong digital strategy as well as take
                advantage of ICED’s social media platforms. 
              </p>

              <p>
