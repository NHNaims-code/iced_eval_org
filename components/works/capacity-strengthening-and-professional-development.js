                Capacity building is integral to the International Centre for
                Evaluation and Development’s (ICED‘s) efforts that seeks to
                provide, inspire, and support thought and practice leadership in
                evaluation profession. The evaluation profession is becoming a
                very fashionable field of work worldwide, and as such is
                attracting people who may lack sufficient skills and insights to
                do justice to the demands of the profession. Professionals need
                the ability to understand development challenges in the Global
                South in depth, nuance and sensitivity to culture and context.
              </p>
              <p>
                ICED seeks to strengthen evaluation professional capacity and
                practices through training, mentoring, couching and exposure
                that - in collaboration with universities and other education
                and training initiatives - fill gaps in current efforts in the
                Global South. The Evaluation profession will bring to bear on
                its theory and practice expertise from other disciplines and
                perspectives from unconventional sources. The
                professionalisation efforts intended here are poised to
                encourage new entrants into the evaluation profession and ICED
                will work collaboratively with academic institution in
                establishing courses of study. To do this requires agility and
                strong professional networks, especially from different
                professions and disciplines in the currently under-represented
                Global South, in order to lead and stay current in a fast-moving
                world.
              </p>

              <p>
                ICED is dedicated to the advancement of evaluation theory and
                practice in the Global South through offering evaluation
                professional trainings in three main areas:
                <ul>
                  <li>Leadership Skills Development</li>
                  <li>Evaluation Communications</li>
                  <li>Management Decision-making</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Evaluation must be conceived and designed with a thorough
                understanding of the initiative and the context within which it
                operates. The capacity building needs to be tailored and
                designed for the context in which it occur
              </p>

              <h3>Background</h3>

              <h4>Definition of Terms</h4>
              <p>
                Capacity here refers the ability of individuals and
                organizations or organizational units to perform functions
                effectively, efficiently and sustainably. ICED uses the term
                Capacity Building to refer to the enhancement of the abilities
                of stakeholder to evaluate and address crucial questions related
                to policy choices and different options for development with the
                intention of facilitating or catalysing capacity development and
                related change processes at the individual, organization and
                societal levels
              </p>

                refers to the education or training of individuals on theory and
                practice of evaluation
              </p>

                is focused on developing and fostering an environment for the
                use of evaluation for development in the Global South to enhance
                decision making

                  Institutional/System capacity building&nbsp;
                </span>
                is related to strengthening and restructuring existing
                institutions and supporting them in forming sound policies,
                organizational structures, and effective methods of management,
                an approach that covers the institutional and organizational
                perspectives
              </p>

              <h4>Rethinking Evaluation as a Profession</h4>

              <p>
                Capacity building is an evidence-driven process that aims at
                strengthening the abilities of individuals, organizations, and
                systems to perform core functions sustainably, and to continue
                to improve and develop over time. Capacity development for
                Evaluation as a Profession should be a more deliberate process
                whereby people, organisations or society takes primary
                responsibility for change process as a whole by creating,
                strengthening and maintaining capacity over time.
              </p>

              <p>
                Evaluation is a profession composed of persons with varying
                interests, potentially encompassing but not limited to the
                evaluation of programs, products, personnel, policy,
                performance, proposals, technology, research, theory and
                practice, and even of evaluation itself. Evaluation involves
                assessing the strengths and weaknesses of programs, policies,
                personnel, products, and organizations to improve their
                effectiveness.
              </p>

              <p>
                ICED believes that evaluation capacity building initiatives (the
                profession and practice of evaluation) are still evolving in the
                Global South. African countries, for example, have set in place
                or are in the process of establishing national monitoring and
                evaluation (M&E) systems to bolster the achievement of their
                development results, however, recent studies reveal that systems
                are not functioning as expected. According to the African
                Capacity Repot (ACR), one of the pervasive capacity challenge
                facing the continent is the inability to achieve development
                results at the national level. In part, this is attributed to
                inadequate capacity or requisite technical capabilities at the
                individual and organizational levels, including weak
                institutional arrangements.
              </p>
              <p>
                ICED intends to address this shortcomings through developing an
                evaluation culture of valuing evidence, valuing questioning, and
                valuing evaluative thinking as a profession. This will require
                developing and building on human capital (knowledge and skills),
                institutional capital (infrastructure and processes) and social
                capital (supportive networks) for effectively managing,
                undertaking and using evaluations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our capacity building programs will driven by clearly defined
                objectives that state what the initiative is intended to achieve
                and how it will accomplish its objectives. Partnerships remains
                a fundamental component of an effective capacity building
                strategy in the context of establishing ownership, support, and
                sustainability of capacity building interventions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, ICED recognizes that Evaluation for Development is
                a specialised profession that demands significant levels of
                evaluative thinking and ethics, appropriate work experience, and
                technical expertise far beyond the application of social
                research methods. Professionals need the ability to understand
                development challenges in the Global South in depth, nuance and
                sensitivity to culture and context.
              </p>

              <h3>Training Programs</h3>
              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>
                The ICED Training is an executive training program that aims to
                provide evaluation professionals with the knowledge, skills and
                tools required to evaluate development policies, programs, and
                projects in the Global South. Drawing on ICED’s robust practical
                experience of implementing capacity building initiatives and
                guided by its principles of investing in individual,
                institutional and systems capacity building that can advance
                though leadership and innovative action the Global South. ICED
                has developed a training programs in collaboration with
                universities and other education institution in Africa that will
                extend and complement its work across five programmatic areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                The training program draws on a diverse professional backgrounds
                and demonstrated competencies and experiences within the
                organization and its network of partners globally to offer
                different forms of training programs to strengthen individual
                and institutional capacities in the Global South. The training
                program operates as a self-propagating initiative with potential
                to enable ICED leverage additional resources to support its
                other core mandates while providing essential services to the
                Global South.
              </p>
              <p>
                The training programs focus on three thematic areas:
                <ul>

              <h3>Our Approach</h3>
              <p>
                Our approach reflects ICED core programme values and objectives,
                both of which are focused on building the capacities of the
                individual, organizations and systems we work with and the
                people they serve. ICED in partnership with others, will develop
                training, mentoring, and couching programs that are context- and
                culture-sensitive, and that fill gaps in current training and
                education efforts in the Global South. These could include:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Targeting high level executives and managers working in
                    other arenas who are interested in learning more about
                    evaluation
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Developing leadership skills, enhancing evaluative thinking
                    and the evaluative aspects of evaluation among evaluation
                    professionals
                  </li>
                  <li>

              <h3>Conceptual Framework Underpinning Capacity Building</h3>
              <p>
                IECD capacity building conceptual framework addresses three
                integrated and reinforcing components: individual,
                organizational, and systems within a social, cultural, and
                economic Global South setting. The diagram below illustrates
                ICED's framework for defining, capturing, and communicating
                evaluation impact (Figure 1). The framework lays emphasis on the
                interrelationship of the three components— the individual,
                organizational and systems— often requiring concurrent and
                sustained capacity strengthening of all levels over time (Figure
                1).
              </p>
              <p>
                The capacity of an individual, an organization or a society is
                not static. It changes over time, and is subject to both
                internal and external influences. Many of these changes are
                unintentional. For example, an organization can lose capacity if
                key individuals leave or change positions within that
                organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                The framework strives to be aligned with program efforts (i.e.
                goals/activities), and that its outputs, performance outcomes,
                and program impacts are documented. The framework is intended to
                support organizations to better articulate the full breadth and
                depth of their capacity building efforts and develop ways to
                measure the degree to which an intervention (or a Program) with
                the intention of facilitating or catalysing capacity development
                and related change processes at the individual, organization and
                societal levels leading to measurable improvements in outputs,
                outcomes and impact.

              <cite>Figure 1. ICED Capacity Building Framework: Evaluation as Profession in the Global South</cite>
              <p>In this framework, capacity comprises the sum of the capabilities of individual/group, organization and/or systems. Exploring capacity building through this lens can help governments and development partners diagnose capacity strengths and weaknesses and thus offer significant potential to enhance evaluation theory. </p>

              <p>At the <span className="inline-bold">
                      Individual Level
