              <h3>Evidence To Action Conference - Nairobi 2018</h3>
              <h4>Introduction</h4>
              <p>
                Information is increasingly becoming the most important currency
                in today’s global economy. With the United Nations predicting
                that the world population will hit the 9 billion mark by the
                year 2050 and that during the same period, Africa’s population
                is expected to double from the current 1.2 billion to 2.5
                billion. In view of the above, there is an urgent need to define
                strategies to enhance Africa’s development Tied to this, there
                is a need to ensure that there is efficient information and
                knowledge being generated by researchers and M&E experts to
                influence decisions by key policymakers. In view of this,
                there’s therefore an ardent need to ensure that ongoing research
                and evaluation projects are producing information that is
                available, accessible, affordable and adoptable.
              </p>

              <p>
                During the past decade, Africa has seen a huge growth and
                interest in production of research, monitoring and evaluation.
                Today, a large number of institutions are investing in
                production of huge amounts of stimulating research results as
                well as M&E data. However for many of them, the production of
                the research report often marks the end of the process, hence
                missing out on an opportunity to create meaningful change by
                influencing policy and practice at both the national and
                institutional level.
              </p>

              <p>
                To aggravate the situation, there continues to be a big
                disconnect between generation and creation of new and solid
                evidence in development systems research efforts and the
                translation of that same evidence into data-informed policies.
                Policy makers struggle to find, collate, understand and apply
                the evidence to support their own decision-making needs, despite
                existing knowledge. These challenges are not insurmountable.
                With the right level of support and collaboration between
                researchers, evaluation experts and decision-makers, the
                translation of evidence-based research findings into actionable
                policy and programmatic guidance is an achievable goal.
              </p>

              <p>
                It is against this background that the International Centre for
                Evaluation and Development (ICED) in conjunction with Tegemeo,
                Atai, BASIS and ISSER is organizing a five day Africa Evidence
                Conference in Nairobi next year to enhance collaboration between
                researchers and stakeholders and outline clear recommendations
                on how to ensure Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) and
                evidence-based research positively impacts regional and national
                priorities and contributes to the attainment of the United
                Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the Malabo
                Declaration.
              </p>

              <p>
                Through this convening, the organizers seek to ensure increased
                uptake and utilization of research and innovation in evaluation
                for development to influence policy and drive change at the
                national, regional and global levels.
              </p>

              <p>
                The conference will offer an exciting platform for renowned
                research and evaluation professionals, and development
                practitioners from national, regional and international
                organizations to tackle important topics such as Agriculture and
                Food Systems in sub-Saharan Africa, Climate Change and
                Environment, Agriculture Risk, Index Insurance and Risk
                Mitigation, Private Sector in Development, Impact of investment
                in Agriculture and Food Systems, Innovative Finance, Credit and
                Savings for Smallholders, Gender and Youth in Agriculture and
                Food Systems, Youth Employment, National and Local Governance
                and Accountability, Evidence Synthesis and Impact Evaluation for
                Policy Making, Knowledge Brokering and Knowledge Translation.
