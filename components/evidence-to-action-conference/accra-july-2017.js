              <h3>Evidence To Action Conference - Accra 2017</h3>
              <h4>Introduction</h4>
              <p>
                Strong agricultural growth is a multiplier for economic growth.
                However, despite the unprecedented decade of impressive
                advancements across the African continent and improved
                governance and improvements in human development indicators,
                African agriculture still faces major challenges. The solution
                to these lingering issues remains unclear in large part because
                there remains a gap between the research on how agricultural
                productivity should be sustainably boosted in Africa and
                agricultural policy development.
              </p>
              <p>
                More than ever, there is a need for strong evidence to better
                inform development professionals, policy makers, donor community
                and private sector investors. This abundance of research
                findings and evaluation reports now needs to be systematically
                reviewed, translated, contextualized, and disseminated to better
                inform policy makers and development practitioners to
                effectively transform African agriculture to increase incomes,
                reduce food insecurity, and put African countries on track to
                achieve sustainable agricultural transformation on the
                continent.
              </p>
              <p>
                Recommendations for policy action in sub-Sahara Africa have not
                been effectively communicated or implemented. There are few
                institutions and organizations actively engaging policy makers,
                development professionals, civil societies and community
                leaders. There continues to be a disconnect between the
                generation and creation of new and solid evidence from
                agricultural and development systems research efforts and the
                translation of that same evidence into data-informed policy
                action. Policy makers struggle to find, collate, understand and
                apply the evidence to support their own decision-making needs,
                despite existing knowledge. These challenges are not
                insurmountable. With the right level of support and
                collaboration between researchers, evaluation experts and
                decision-makers, the translation of evidence-based research
                findings into actionable policy and programmatic guidance is an
                achievable goal.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this background in mind, the International Centre for
                Evaluation and Development (ICED) and ISSER are partnering with
                the Agricultural Technology Adoption Initiative (ATAI), the Feed
                the Future Innovation Lab for Assets and Market Access (AMA
                Innovation Lab), to organize two regional conferences to be held
                in Africa in May and July 2017.
              </p>
              <p>
                The two conferences, which will be organized under the same
                theme -- “Evidence to Action” – towards a measured driven and
                data informed policy for action to enhance collaboration between
                researchers and stakeholders and outline clear recommendations
                on how to ensure Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) and
                evidence-based research positively impacts regional and national
                priorities and contributes to the attainment of the United
                Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the Malabo
                Declaration.
              </p>
              <h4>Conference Objectives</h4>
              <p>
                The purpose of this convening is to promote evidence from
                rigorous impact evaluations and research and to encourage
                increased uptake and utilization of research and innovation in
                evaluation to influence policy and drive change at the national,
                regional and global levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                The conference provides an excellent platform for researchers,
                academics, private sector practitioners, development agencies,
                civil society and policy makers to learn, share information,
                build networks and partnerships with the overall objective of
                identifying effective strategies and interventions for ensuring
                data generated from research and evaluation projects is well
                utilized.
              </p>
