                                The need for more and better evidence from research and evaluation of
                                development programs has never been more crucial as Africa directs its
                                efforts towards accomplishing its commitment to the Africa Union’s Agenda 2063,
                                and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Agenda 2030 during
                                and beyond the COVID 19 Pandemic. With the current context and the challenges facing
                                the world and compounded by the conflict in Ukraine and the food shortages/insecurity
                                as well as the rising fuel prices and shortages, sound evidence is essential to inform
                                policy making, development actions, and citizenry perception of the impact of the agendas.
